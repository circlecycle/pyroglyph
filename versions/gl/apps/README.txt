The Pyroglyph Runtime, copyright James Robey 2007
contact: circlecycle@gmail.com 

This package depends on (install in this order!):
    python 2.x and up, available from http://python.org
    the PyOpenGL package available from http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/
    The free type library available from http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/freetype-2.3.5.tar.bz2
    the PIL Imaging Library available from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

The simplest way of getting some output is to CD to the pyroglyph module (where this readme.txt file is) and run "python pg.py ./tests/threading.lzx"

If it works you'll get a window with some boxes in it doing tricks. An auspicious beginning! In the near future dependancy will be reduced using pyglet and maybe even pave the way for an OSX App, but that is not yet... stay tuned!
